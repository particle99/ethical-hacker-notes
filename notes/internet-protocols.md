# Internet protocols

## Application Layer

### HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
> **HyperText Transfer Protocol** (abbreviated **HTTP**) is a protocol used for fetching and requesting resources such as HTML documents.
> It is the foundation of data exchange on the web and runs on a client-server protocol, so requests are created by the **client** (usually loading up a web-page).
> Messages sent to and from the server to the client are **individual** messages, as opposed to a **stream** of data.
> Messages sent to the server are called **requests** and messages sent to the client from the server are called **responses**.
> A complete web-page or document is created from various **sub-documents**, requested from the server by the client (these include things like images, videos or files).
> HTTP protocol sends messages over the **Transmission Control Protocol** (abbreviated **TCP**), a **TLS** encrypted connection, to ensure reliability.

### Teletype Network (telnet)
> **Teletype Network** (abbreviated **telnet**) is a client-server protocol which provides access to virtual **terminals** of **remote systems** on the internet.
> **Remote systems** is the practice of controlling a computer from a remote location, often using **telnet** or **ssh**.
> In time, telnet was overtaken by **Secure Shell** (abbreviated **ssh**) due to telnet having a lack of security and policies.

### Secure Shell (ssh)
> **Secure Shell** (abbreviated **ssh**) is a secure protocol for remotely administering servers or terminals.
> SSH overtook **telnet** due to ssh being more secure than it's predecessor.
